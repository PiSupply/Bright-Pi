# Third party software libraries

It is safe to say we have an awesome and growing community of people using Bright Pi to light up their projects and we get a huge amount of contributions of code, some of which we can easily integrate here and others which we can't (we are only a small team). However we want to make sure that any contributions are easy to find, for anyone looking. So here is a list of other software libraries that might be useful to you (if you have one of your own, please visit the ["Issues"](https://github.com/PiSupply/Bright-Pi/issues) tab above and let us know!):
